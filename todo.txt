Outstanding:
8. Make comments on comments
    ✓ Optimize how we populate
    ✓ Make comments embedded inside comments
    3. Test that comments on comments are working
9. Vote a post up or down
    1. Make vote form
    2. Add jQuery AJAX scripts
    3. Write "vote up" and "vote down" routes
    4. Add new attributes to POST model
    5. Update DOM with response
10. More tests - fix post test

Moar:
11. Go back through tutorial to find stretch challenges
12. Vote a comment up or down
13. Create a post on a subreddit
14. Show all subreddits
15. Standardize syntax across the board
16. Commentate

Odds and Ends:
* Form in SIGN-UP should be in middle third of grid, per tutorial
* To allow main templates to work, you need to add currentUser to all routes calling res.render(). Brainstorm how to make
  it DRY.
* About halfway thru pg. 8 (Associate post, comments with their author) on updating CREATE in posts controller: Suggestion
  to create another example of custom middleware called CHECKAUTH and use it on routes that require user to be logged in.
  Rewrite CREATE into its own middleware called "CheckAuth"
